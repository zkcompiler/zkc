# Roadmap

Development extends one supported model: `.zkc` Language → mathematical MLIR →
`zkc.program/1` → the shared Rust Runner and Entry/proof/joint Hosts.
[Status](status.md) records existing support; this page orders further work.

## Strengthen the maintained path

Keep Schnorr and Sumcheck libraries, their source Entries, relation data import
and installed C++/Rust consumers representative of the public workflow. New
capabilities should use the existing profiles and interpreter, with explicit
formation, transformation, admission, execution and failure contracts.

Preserve general algebra, relation Assets, native kernels, structured messages,
resource custody, iteration, completion and attempts. Broader source syntax and
new protocol libraries are additions to this model, with no obligation to port
retired applications. Lean research develops independently.

## Establish native correspondence

Select one concrete `.zkc`/MLIR protocol, source semantics, observation boundary
and executable contract. Connect the actual emitted program and runtime behavior
to that subject, including received values, ordered effects, stopped prefixes,
resource successors and terminal decisions. Reuse independent Lean laws only
through an explicit interpretation with their hypotheses discharged.

Compiler postconditions and C++/Rust agreement remain useful regression evidence.
They do not replace a semantics for native execution or prove backend kernels.
[Preservation](compiler/preservation.md) states the existing comparisons;
[assurance](assurance.md) identifies their remaining trust boundaries.

## Develop transcript assurance

Fix the statement, transcript encoding, sampling policy and adversarial experiment
before claiming Fiat–Shamir security. Native public-coin analysis checks selected
verifier dependencies; transcript construction checks observations and state
threading. Neither is a random-oracle reduction. Repeated attempts require a
separate treatment of retained provider state, failed work and adversarial trials.

The [public-coin profile](spec/profiles/compiler/public-coin.md) and
[native proof contract](spec/profiles/compiler/native-proofs.md) remain the
contract owners. Changes to the single `/4` policy must update compiler
production, Host admission and controls together. Setup authority remains at
Entry inputs and the Host registry, with explicit verifier-key-consuming PCS
checks in the protocol.

## Extend on demonstrated demand

The current service registry supports four RNG distributions/providers. Arbitrary
user-defined request/reply families need a separately designed contract and
implementation when a concrete client requires them.

New relation frontends must preserve exact field, public layout and relation
identity across their adapter. LLZK remains a generic relation adapter in its
own toolchain. A successful import does not establish source encoding adequacy.

New kernels, larger capacity and optimizations need complete-result comparisons
at their supported sizes, including exhaustion where claimed. Performance
results state their workload, configuration and baseline. Add new protocol
applications when they motivate useful compiler work; an application-specific
compatibility requirement must be selected explicitly with its consumer.
